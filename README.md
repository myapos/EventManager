# EventManager 
The web application EventManager is an appropriate web application where visitors can learn about the events who are taking place in geographical locations. The type of events consists mainly of cultural events in the areas of municipalities of Greece for example the municipality of Heraklion. The depiction of events is done with 3 ways to calendar, map and rotating text. The system can support three different types of users. These are guests, users and administrators (admin). Depending on the categorization of the users the system shows the appropriate messages and capabilities of each category. Especially the manager has access to protected areas of application which can register through appropriate forms of events in the system. In next step the events are displayed to the homepage after obtaining the event data from the system database. For the construction of the application we used open source technologies. More specifically, the following technologies that we used are

1.	Play Framework 2.4.2 “Damiya” https://www.playframework.com/
